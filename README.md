# Let's Go

This is a website designed to help older and more vulnerable people stay connected and thrive during the new normal. It allows those who are less technologically minded to take advantage of internet.

It is broken down into 4 pages:
Let's Move - Provides embedded workout videos to help get users moving
Let's Learn - A way of learning a new skill to keep users thinking at home
Let's Explore - A way of seeing the world from the comfort of your own home
Family - A series of videos teaching users how to use software and websites designed to keep users connected such as social media

## Deployment

Let's Go has been deployed to github pages and is accessible [here](https://ngiappuoykoh.github.io/Hackathon-Jul-2020-Team7/)

## UX

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to continue to talk to my friends and family while staying safe and social distancing
- As a user, I want to learn new things while I am cocooning
- As a user, I want to see beautiful parts of the world from my home
- As a user, I want to stay active in interesting and new ways

The Let's Go Website achieves this by

- Providing users with informative videos of how to use the best communication tools out there such as Zoom and whatsapp. It also teaches users how to set up and use their social media, all of which helps users remain connected.
- Providing handy links to guides on cooking various meals. There is enough variety that there is going to be something the user hasn't tried.
- Allowing the user to see the world through other peoples eyes, showing video and interactive footage of museums and the great outdoors.
- Showing users through videos, new and interesting ways to stay fit. These videos show step by step what the user can do or will do the workout with them.

### User Experience

The site is built for ease of use for those that are less technologically minded such as the elderly.

Bright contrasting colours are used to show different sections of the screen so that it is clear which section you are heading for.

Let's go has been designed to be used on any screen size, with a particular focus on tablets as this is what we assume the main user base will access the site from.

The process of designing the website began with team members providing wireframes of their thoughts for the site. The best features of the wireframes were voting on and used for the website. Wireframes are available to view [here](https://github.com/NgiapPuoyKoh/Hackathon-Jul-2020-Team7/tree/master/wireframes). An example is shown:

## Technologies Used

### Languages and Frameworks

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Bootstrap

### Tools Used

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): Used to create wireframes
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/): IDE used for creating and editing code
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#): Used for site testing at various screen sizes

## Testing

The site was tested to ensure proper usability on all screen sizes. Both Am I Responsive and Google Inspect were used to make sure the website fitted well into whichever screen size the user chose to view the website on.

The User stories were tested by getting each individual memeber of the team to load up the site and various devices, such as tablets and phones, they were then able to test that the users were able to access content in the same number of clicks regardless of device. This also allowed us to make sure technologies such as modals and videos would work on all devices.
